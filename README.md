# Rhythm-animation

Postmortem:
I started out with much bigger ambitions for this project. It was meant to generate Delaunay-style paintings based on coordinate data and user input. As you can see, it turned into a simple animation of my version of “Rythm no. 1076” by Sonia Delaunay. I realised that my original idea was far too ambitious and would require much more time and skill than I had at my disposal. That said, I remain proud of this little project that honours one of my favourite painters. 

Artistic statement:
Sonia and Robert Delaunay are famous for their giant abstract shapes filled with vibrant colours. Having grown up in Paris, I used to always search for an excuse to go see their paintings in the Musée d’Art Moderne and stare at them. One impression has stuck with me over the years and comes back every time I am faced with these works: it seems to me that these paintings for the product of fun. I am utterly convinced that they enjoyed themselves in what I see as an almost childish, innocent fun while creating these shapes. This is why I wanted to recreate, in a sense, the process.
